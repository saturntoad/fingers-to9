This is just a small game written by Saturn Zhang.
It could be fun if you have played this game by
hands in your childhood.

To download it,  please click on the "Downloads" tab and choose the lastest build file.
It is written in Java, so you must have JRE installed in order to run it.
You can download JRE from "http://www.java.com/download" .

Now this programme is very immature and needs to be
tested and improved. So please feel free to play with
it and I would really appreciate it if you are so
kind to report bugs as well as give advice to

saturntoad@gmail.com   .

Enjoy it!!!
